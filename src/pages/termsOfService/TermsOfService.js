            </Stack>
                    <p>Hello and welcome! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are an agreement formed between you
                (“You”) and Transmedia Corp. (“Company,” “playlife.app” “we” or “us”) and cover the website
                available at playlife.app (the “Website”), and the related applications (the “App”) operated on
                behalf of playlife.app, and together with any content, tools, features and functionality offered on or
                through our Website and App (the “Services”).</p>
                    <p>These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services. Please read them carefully, as
                they include important information about your legal rights. By accessing and/or using the
                Services, you’re agreeing to these Terms. If you don’t understand or agree to these Terms,
                please don’t use the Services.</p>
                    <p>For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services. If you use
                the Services on behalf of a company or other entity then “you” includes you and that entity, and
                you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the
                authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s
                behalf.</p>
                    <p>Note: these Terms contain an arbitration clause and class action waiver. By agreeing to these
                Terms, you agree (a) to resolve all disputes with us through binding individual arbitration, which
                means that you waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and (b) that
                you waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative actions.
                You have the right to opt-out of arbitration as explained below.</p>

            <Stack><h3>3. Intellectual Property Rights</h3></Stack>
                    <p>User Content Uploaded to the Site. With respect to the content or other materials you upload to
                or create using the Services (collectively, “User Content”), you represent and warrant that you
                own all right, title and interest in and to such User Content, including, without limitation, all
                copyrights and rights of publicity contained therein, or are otherwise permitted to use them for
                the applicable purposes, for example by license or legal exception or limitation. By creating or
                uploading any User Content you own or create using the Service, you retain all rights in it (to the
                extent you would otherwise hold such rights) and hereby grant and will grant playlife.app to the
                fullest extent permitted under the law a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up,
                transferable, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable license to copy, display, upload, perform,
                distribute, store, modify and otherwise use your User Content for any playlife.app-related purpose
                in any form, medium or technology now known or later developed.</p>
                    <p>Website or Services Content, Software and Trademarks. You acknowledge and agree that the
                Website or Services may contain content or features (“Site Content”) that are protected by
                copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights and laws. In connection
                with your use of the Website or Services you will not engage in or use any data mining, robots,
                scraping or similar automated data gathering or extraction methods. If you are blocked by
                PalyLife.ai from accessing the Website or Services (including by blocking your IP address), you
                agree not to implement any measures to circumvent such blocking (e.g., by masking your IP
                address or using a proxy IP address). Any use of the Website or Services, or the Site Content,
                other than as specifically authorized herein is strictly prohibited. Any rights not expressly
                granted herein are reserved by playlife.app.</p>
                    <p>The playlife.app name and logos are trademarks of Character AI (collectively the “Character AI
                Trademarks”).<br/>
                Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration
                Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
    
            <Stack><h3>4. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3></Stack>
                    <p>Pplaylife.app is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and fairly, and so if you have
                concerns, we strongly encourage you to first contact us about them at legal@playlife.app. If such
                efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other,
                by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to playlife.app should be sent to
                playlife.app 251 Crandon Blvd, #526, Key Biscayne, FL 33149 (“Notice Address”). The Notice
                must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief
                sought. If playlife.app and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the
                Notice is received, you or playlife.app may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
                arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by playlife.app or you shall not be disclosed
                to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or playlife.app
                is entitled.</p>
    
            <Stack><h3>5. Arbitration Procedures</h3></Stack>
                    <p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with JAMS’ (“JAMS”)
                Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (collectively, the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by
                this Arbitration Agreement. For information on JAMS, please visit its website,
                https://www.jamsadr.com/. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the JAMS Rules
                and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement
                will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
                Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also
                follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
                including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
                Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
                streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same
                damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the
                Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
                overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>
                    <p>Unless playlife.app and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Miami, FL.
                If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by JAMS. If
                your claim is for $10,000 or less, playlife.app agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration
                will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
                telephonic or video conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS
                Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS
                Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue
                a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
                the award is based.<br/>
                Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
                “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
                Arbitration Agreement.</p>
                    <p>Confidentiality<br/>
                All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will
                be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>
                    <p>Severability<br/>
                If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement is
                invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or
                provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
                invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable
                as so modified.</p>
                    <p>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement<br/>
                Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Use to the contrary, playlife.app agrees that if it
                makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice
                Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending
                playlife.app written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address
                provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any
                dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date
                you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

            <Stack><h3>6. Termination</h3></Stack>
                    <p>You agree that playlife.app, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any
                part thereof) or use of the Services and remove and discard any content within the Website or
                Services, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if playlife.app believes that
                you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms. playlife.app may
                also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Services, or any part thereof,
                with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services under any
                provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that
                playlife.app may (but has no obligation to) immediately deactivate or delete your account and all
                related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the
                Services. Termination of your account or access to any component of the Services will not
                terminate playlife.app’s rights to your User Content. Further, you agree that playlife.app will not be
                liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Services.</p>
    
            <Stack><h3>7. General</h3></Stack>
                    <p>Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and playlife.app
                and govern your use of our Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and
                playlife.app with respect to the Services.<br/>
                Choice of Law, Jurisdiction, Venue. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of
                Florida without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not
                subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and playlife.app agree to submit to the personal and
                exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Miami-Dade County, Florida.</p>
                    <p>Severance. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
                invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
                parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain
                in full force and effect.</p>
                    <p>No Waiver.<br/>
                Any failure of playlife.app to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not
                constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br/>
                Expiration of Claims. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim
                or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed
                within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.<br/>
                Admissibility. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will
                be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement
                to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and
                records originally generated and maintained in printed form.<br/>
                Assignment. You may not assign these Terms without the prior written consent of playlife.app, but
                playlife.app may assign or transfer these Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without restriction.
                The Site may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by
                displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Website.</p>

            <Stack><h3>8. Changes to these Terms</h3></Stack>
                    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms at any
                time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page
                the date these terms were last revised. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than
                fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the
                Site or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the
                Site after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new
                Terms.</p>
